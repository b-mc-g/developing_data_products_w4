## Application to predict the Iris Species based on Petal & Sepal Width and Length values

You can select using the slider bars values for 

* petal width 
* petal length 
* sepal width 
* sepal length 

These could be based e.g. on experimental values.

Using the Iris data set supplied with R a Random Forest model is generated.

The model is then used to predict the species based on the entered values for Petals & Sepals set using the slider bars.

The prediction output can be viewed after the "Predict Species"" button is pressed.

The prediction can be found on the Plots Tab below the Plots section in the Main Window on Right.

Step one
Enter the measurements
Press Predict Species
Review the probalilites in the Prediction Table. 

The values add up to one giving a probabilty prediction per species for a given set of values

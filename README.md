PLEASE NOTE
When testing the app on shinyapps.io using the Predict Species button the server connection is terminated and a relaod is required.
Looking at the shinyapps.io logs the packages dplyr and e1071 were missing. They are  now loaded in the server.R file
It is working better now in 3 browsers.
Backup is to test the app Predict Species output to HTML  you might need to download the ui.R and server.R and run them locally.
